Hi, I'm Paweł Gębal, backend software developer from Poland.

It is my blog, and I am going to write about anything I want.
But it will always be one of the three things every man should master:

1. **programming** - it's fun, challenging, makes you constantly learn new things, understand new concepts, allows to build something useful.
And it makes you decent bucks if you're good at it.
2. **fitness** - if you sit 10 - 12 hours a day in front of a computer and not exercise at all
you'll develop bad posture and get fat. Start working out instead of spending the bucks you earned on health care.
3. **soft skills** - software engineering is a team work and you should be a team player.
Not to mention that being more open, friendly and confident will make you better with girls.

Since I am mastering all of the above for a few years now I belive I have something valuable to share.
Expect posts about functional programming, Scala, reactive systems, programming books reviews,
 proper strength training, negotiating a raise and more.
