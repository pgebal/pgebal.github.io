I like trying new things. When I was coding a microservice for
my project I decided to stay away from Slick and use [Quill][quill] instead.
Quill is fresh and [growing][quill-popularity].
Version 1.0.1 was released in December 2016.
I gave it a try, I am happy with it and I want to share that happiness with you.

## How it works (in a nutshell)? ##
Quill provides a Quoted Domain Specific Language that allows to
type query in Scala in a way as you were using a collection and runs it in a supported language.
To achieve that two things happen:
 {: .text-justify}

* query is translated (macros!) at compile time to an Abstract Syntax Tree
* tree is normalized and then translated to a chosen query language depending on provided context.
 SQL and CQL are supported.


All of this is backed by a [strong science][quill-science].

## Fast start ##
This section will let you play with Quill blazingly fast.

We'll be using MySQL database.
Let's set it up with docker.
Open a terminal and execute those two commands:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight shell%}
docker run --name quill-mysql-async -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes -e MYSQL_USER=quill_demo -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=quill_demo -e MYSQL_DATABASE=quill_demo -d mysql/mysql-server:5.7
docker exec -it quill-mysql-async mysql -uquill_demo -pquill_demo quill_demo -e "CREATE TABLE Account(ownerName VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY, balance BIGINT NOT NULL);"
{% endhighlight %}

We have installed MySQL server.
Let's move to coding.
Create a new project with activator:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight shell %}
./activator new quill-mysql-async minimal-scala
{% endhighlight %}

Add Quill to build.sbt:
{% highlight scala %}
libraryDependencies += "io.getquill" %% "quill-async-mysql" % "1.0.1"
{% endhighlight %}

Put context configuration into the application.conf:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight scala %}
db {
  host=127.0.0.1
  port=3306
  user=quill_demo
  password=quill_demo
  database=quill_demo
}
{% endhighlight %}

We are going to implement small demo app that stores and retrieves data about bank accounts.
Our domain consists of one object:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight scala %}
case class Account(ownerName: String, balance: Long)
{% endhighlight %}

We'll use **AccountDao** object to access the database:
{% highlight scala %}
import io.getquill._

import scala.concurrent.Future
/*in a real life you would rather pass execution context as
  a method or constructor argument, but we're just playing*/
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

object AccountDao {

  private val ctx = new MysqlAsyncContext[CamelCase]("db")

  import ctx._

  def selectJohnsBalance: Future[Option[Long]] = {
    val select = quote {
      query[Account].filter(_.ownerName == "John").map(_.balance)
    }
    ctx.run(select)
      .map(_.headOption)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's all the code we need to know how rich John is.
**select** is the query and **ctx** is the context in which the query is run.
{: .text-justify}

ASTs are built at compile time so you can not refer a runtime value in a query.
You can deal with that by lifting the value to a quotation using **lift** method.
That allows to bind runtime value to a quotation execution.
Knowing that let's add the following methods to **AccountDao**:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight scala %}
def selectWealthierThan(minimalBalance: Int): Future[List[String]] = {
  val select = quote {
    query[Account].filter(_.balance > lift(minimalBalance)).map(_.ownerName)
  }
  ctx.run(select)
}

def insert(accounts: List[Account]): Future[List[Account]] = {
  val insert = quote {
    // we lift accounts
    liftQuery(accounts).foreach(t => query[Account].insert(t))
  }
  ctx.run(insert)
     .map(_ => accounts)
}

def delete: Future[Long] = ctx.run(quote {
  query[Account].delete
})
{% endhighlight %}
Compilation produces the following output:
{% highlight shell%}
[info] Compiling 3 Scala sources to /home/pawel/Projects/quill-async/target/scala-2.11/classes...
[info] /home/pawel/Projects/quill-async/src/main/scala/com/pawelgebal/quillplayground/AccountDao.scala:18: SELECT x1.balance FROM Account x1 WHERE x1.ownerName = 'John'
[info]     ctx.run(select)
[info]            ^
[info] /home/pawel/Projects/quill-async/src/main/scala/com/pawelgebal/quillplayground/AccountDao.scala:26: SELECT x4.ownerName FROM Account x4 WHERE x4.balance > ?
[info]     ctx.run(select)
[info]            ^
[info] /home/pawel/Projects/quill-async/src/main/scala/com/pawelgebal/quillplayground/AccountDao.scala:33: INSERT INTO Account (ownerName,balance) VALUES (?, ?)
[info]     ctx.run(insert)
[info]            ^
[info] /home/pawel/Projects/quill-async/src/main/scala/com/pawelgebal/quillplayground/AccountDao.scala:37: DELETE FROM Account
[info]   def delete: Future[Long] = ctx.run(quote {
{% endhighlight %}
Yes, those are the generated queries!

Let's run our example:
{% highlight scala %}
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch

import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

object Accounts extends App {

  val latch = new CountDownLatch(1)

  import AccountDao._

  val wealthyPeople = for {
    _ <- insert(List(Account("John", 1000), Account("Jane", 2000), Account("Jack", 3000)))
    wealthy <- selectWealthierThan(1500)
    _ <- delete
  } yield wealthy

  wealthyPeople.foreach(wealthy => {
    wealthy.foreach(println)
    latch.countDown()
  })

  latch.await()
}
{% endhighlight %}
It prints
{% highlight shell %}
Jane
Jack
{% endhighlight %}
on your console.

We did not put any boilerplate that maps table or column names to case classes and fields.
Quill deduces database schema from case class definitions using naming strategies that you provide when creating a context.
Naming can be customized by explicitly providing a schema as a quotation and using **Literal** naming strategy.
Example:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight scala %}
private val ctx = new MysqlAsyncContext[Literal]("db")

private def selectJohnDoe: Future[Option[Account]] = {
   val accounts = quote {
     querySchema[Account]("ACCOUNT", _.ownerName -> "owner_name")
   }
   val select = quote {
     accounts.filter(_.ownerName == "John Doe")
   }
   ctx.run(select) // SELECT x8.owner_name, x8.balance FROM ACCOUNT x8 WHERE x8.owner_name = 'John Doe'
      .map(_.headOption)
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Asynchronous contexts ##
Quill comes with multiple contexts for all relevant SQL dialects.
You can use jdbc but if you need to be fully non-blocking pick **MysqlAsyncContext** or **PostgresAsnycContext** depending on which database you use.
Both contexts support transactions and use [asynchronous database drivers][db-async] implemented on top of netty.
{: .text-justify}

## Gotchas ##

#### Do not provide explicit types for quotations ####
Providing an explicit type for a quotation is a bad idea, because then type refinement cannot be applied at compile time.
So rather don't do this:
{: .text-justify}
{% highlight scala %}
def select: Quote[Query[String]] = quote {
    query[Account].filter(_.balance > 100).map(_.ownerName)
  }
{% endhighlight %}
It will work but normalization and query generation will happen at runtime.
{: .text-justify}

#### Async drivers are poorly documented ####
**PostgresAsyncContext** and **MySqlAsyncContext** use them so be prepared for some code digging if things work other way than you expected.
Use **JdbcContext** if you want to feel safe.

## Final thoughts ##
Quill looks solid and I like the brevity it provides.
I'll stick to it in my projects.
Stay tuned and be ready for more Quill posts.
