I know that microservcies are hard.
I've learnt that the hard way when I was prematurely employed as a software architect.
If I had read [Building Microservices][building-microservices-affiliate-link] back then I would have made wiser choices.

The book doesn't go into technical details and focuses on presenting a set of principles that are working now and will be valid for a next few years.
[Sam Newman][sam-newman] briefly covers modeling microservices on business domain boundaries, communication between microservices and delivering scalable solutions built on them.
More emphasis is put on chapters that are strongly related to the topics that the author has been mastering for quite a few years, that is continuous delivery, security, monitoring and how they relate to architecture that embraces microservices.

Building Microservices is a good and quite easy read for beginners and intermediate developers.
The great thing is that after reading it I was super pumped up and started daydreaming about making those great systems that are deployed with one click and are so resilient that I can unleash a Chaos Monkey on them and they still serve millions of users.

Before buying the book, check out [Sam Newman's talk from Devoxx][devoxx-newman-presentation] to see if you like his style and high level approach.

The best [talk on microservices][goto-microserices-at-netflix] I've seen.
