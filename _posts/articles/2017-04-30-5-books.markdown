During my first year as a software developer I have not read a single book that would boost skills I needed for my job.
Back then girls, fitness and leisure where my top priorities.
I am still happy about girls and fitness but looking back it was not a wise choice to chill as much as I did.
I should have read books back then and I should have started with those five.

##### 1. [<u>How to Win Friends and Influence People</u>][winfriends-amazon] by Dale Carnagie
I felt my social skills were decent but I still have learned a lot by reading this book.
It applies to professional and private life.
Want to get along with your family, lovers, team, manager and all the others? Want to be a good leader? Want to know how to win people to your ways of thinking?
This book can teach you that.
Without any tricks, just by being sincere and gentle.

##### 2. [<u>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</u>][deepwork-amazon] by Cal Newport
That one was released last year and it's great.
Writing code is a cognitively demanding tasks.
To be productive you need to focus and move all distractions out of your way.
Cal Newport (born 1982) is an associate professor in the department of computer science at Georgetown University and knows thing or two about staying focused.
He delivers scientific papers on computer science and published five books with advice how to effectively work on demanding tasks.
In Deep work he shares his and other's people views on how to stay focused, work deep and deliver things in a way that does not make you to work on weekends.
Apply what the book says, code better and faster and send professor Newport a thank you letter.

##### 3. [<u>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</u>][cleancode-amazon] by Robert Martin
It's a gem.
If you want to code, do it clean.
If you want to do it clean, read this book and do what Robert Martin says.
Period.

##### 4. [<u>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</u>][cleancode2-amazon] by Robert Martin
Coding for money does not make you a professional software engineer.
Applying what Robert Martin says in this book will make a professional.
This is a comprehensive tutorial on becoming a craftsman.
That book will help you to understand what being a professional means when it comes to your code, obligations you make, and ways how you treat other people.
There are harsh words of truth in this book.
But you may need them if you are willing to put the work to better yourself as a developer.

##### 5. [<u>Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual</u>][simpleprogrammer-amazon] by John Sonmez
How to Win Friends and Influence People will not teach you all the soft skills you need.
Neither this book.
But it is still a great read.
It is a manual on how to make you career move forward and what to do with the money you earn.
There are tips on how to squeeze some more value out of your free time.
If you are not regularly hitting the gym yet, this book might get you started with fitness.
John Sonmez has a [youtube channel][simpleprogrammer-youtube] and a [blog][simpleprogrammer-blog].
